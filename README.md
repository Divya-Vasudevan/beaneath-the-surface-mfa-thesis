This repository includes prototyping I did with light animations using arduino for the physical exhibit that I had planned to create before COVID. 
Since the goal was to use multiple Arduino Uno's driven by a raspberry pi that was recognising user actions, I have done the development using the Johnny Five platform: http://johnny-five.io/. The code can be found in the light-animations folder.

The App folder contains the basic wireframe prototype of the app experience. This is a work in progress and at the moment the QR code scanning functionality is working.
